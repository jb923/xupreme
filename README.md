## Conclusion
Overall, Xupreme was fun to make and I genuinely cared about this project. I always had a passion in technology and fashion. To put the two together into one project kept me focused and determined to make it as authentic as possible. Some challenges were the use of sizes for some of the products was a little tricky and required some data manipulation. It was a challange at first but I was able to get it down. It helped me understand the flow of data a little better throughout my project. Of course there are always more elements that can be added to any project but for this project I believe this is a great starting off point.
